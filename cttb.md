# Man-Man

how would you react if...
you were bit by a man who was radioactive?

<hr/>

## Man-Man! (title song)

He can punch with the strength of two men
By the time you get there, he's already back again
Let's hear about that hero
Hitherto unsung
Ocasionally he can... roll his tongue!

He's Man-Man!
The man with all the powers of a man

You can call him insane, but how would you react if
You too were bit by a man who was radioactive
The streets are getting harder
You know evil never slumbers
But Man-Man's got two social security numbers

He's Man-Man!
(no one's stealing HIS secret identity)

Is it a bird
or is it a plane
yeah it's a plane, but look! down on the ground!
it's Man-Man
and he can't fly
(that would be really cool though)

When he cooks minute rice it's finished 30 seconds later
He reaches the tops of tall buildings with a single elevator!

He's Man-Man!

Man-Man you're a hero
How do you stay so brave
Embracing your worst fear for all the people that you save
There's a man sewn upon your cape
But how that man must haunt ya
Since your parents were shot outside La Man of La Mancha

Man-Man...
