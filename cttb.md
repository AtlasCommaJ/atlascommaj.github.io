## Hello, World!
#### EVE:   
Hello world  
Hey, have you been growing?  
Just like me you're a little less green  

Hey there lamppost   
Whatcha knowin  
Ssh! I'm a shadow, don't go telling where I've been  

So lights off me!  
I'm the hole in the wall now,  
Don't want to be seen, Eve's dropping by for a spell   
I want to hear about you, guy!  
My heart—well it bleeds, see?    
Start unraveling that song I know you're dying to tell  

#### MALLORY:   
Hello world  
You just keep getting simpler  
Less time to run means you're quick to corrupt   

Hello little town  
I like what you've assembled   
But I'll learn your tics and—tock!—your time'll be up  

So lights on me!  
I'm the whole of it all now,   
Hot on the scene, swapping heaven for hell  
Come step up and buy,  
Forgive us if we're greedy  
We've been traveling so long and now we're dying to sell  

#### BOTH TOGETHER:  
Hello world  
Key pairs can't beat this Queen pair  
We're racing to go, we're braced and we're curled   
You can't imagine the byzantine affair  
Created by a couple of girls

## The Bridges of Könisberg County
#### ALICE: 

Another bridge  
Keep your balance, lose a face but find your edge  
I'm memoryless  
All that counts is right now for what's next   
...don't know where I was but I know where I'm going  

There's nowhere to face but forward  
And lean into the curve  
From the start to the end it's been odd even then  
Escape with vim, a little verve  
Show me the best of seven bridges  
And I'll have crossed them all  

To cross again  
To finally feel a little loss again  
Without the smallest cut, you'll never know,   
Your capacity for flow  
...who would I be if I let you sink me?  

No! There's nothing to face but forward  
And lean into the curve  
It's not just brute force it's a new kind of source  
In the end it's all conserved  
Show me the best of seven bridges  
And I'll have crossed them...

All my life I have been walking  
I have been walking, randomly  
By the river banks and the perfect park  
Feeding martingales and the meadowlarks  
Share your bread and beer and they'll like you nice  
But who ever sees the same bird twice?  
They get drunk and lost forever, somewhere free  
While I stumble home almost surely  

Too easily  
To finally break this ergodicity  
I swore I'd stay, to stay here, stationary  
I assumed, you and me  
Irreducibillity  
I'd step to you again  
Something I can value  

but now, there's...  

...nothing to face, but forward  
And lean into the curves  
There's a chance to live a life that maybe I don't deserve  
Show me the best of seven bridges  
Across two islands in the river  
Out of this undirected county
