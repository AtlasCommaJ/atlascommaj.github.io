    <h1>Alas, Jetsam</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm trying to revive this website. It used to be built on Ruby and Jekyll, but I'm replacing that with vanilla
        HTML for now. I'll either figure out how to reinstall gems and the other dependencies, or just rewrite it with
        some other framework.</p>
    <p>It's a few years later now, and I didn't do any of that reinstalling or replacing or even writing. I'm back now
        though. We'll see how long this lasts.</p>

    <h2 id="museum">Museum of Hangovers</h2>
    <p>A little of a play on words here. I have three months between the bar exam and when I start work. Post-bar, so
        "hangover," hah. A year ago in Zagreb, Peter and I visited the Museum of Hangovers one morning before we left
        for Slovenia. Remarkable place.</p>
    <p>Not sure what I'll do with the time. I'll need to move, either straight to New York or somewhere else
        intervening. For the past day or two I've been kicking around the idea of finally getting into film. Not with
        the expectation of it turning into anything career-wise, and I suppose I'm doing less than everything I could be
        doing towards that if I did want it. But maybe as a hobby. My favorite part of this past year were the thirty
        minutes making the commercial for the Pub. Why not keep that going. Need to build some competency first.</p>
    <p>I'll try to do something every day. I'll try to write every day about it, too. Something will come of it.</p>
    <p>August 6. [Formatting will change eventually. Maybe I should go back to the blog style? Not sure. When I last
        worked on this site, I thought it'd be about me becoming a professional tetris player. How things change...]
        Today I watched a YouTube video or two about making films, then got sidetracked by a suggestion about Fleabag,
        which led me to Normal People, and now I'm watching that.</p>
    <p>I code just seldomly enough to remember how to set up GitHub credentials. Do they change it all the time? Or has
        there been the same message about passwords being retired for tokens for years, and every time I forget that
        it's not a new alert? Anyway, hope this works.</p>
    <div> I'll try to format this as paragraph tags inside a div tag for each session. (Can you put a \<\p\> inside a \
            <\div\>? I forget.)
                <p>I think I'd quite like quality acting to happen because of me. Makes for a reason to be.</p>
                <p>Funny that we're to believe they're in high school.</p>
                <p>Rescheduled my dentist appointment just in time.</p>
