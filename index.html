    <h1>Alas, Jetsam</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm trying to revive this website. It used to be built on Ruby and Jekyll, but I'm replacing that with vanilla
        HTML for now. I'll either figure out how to reinstall gems and the other dependencies, or just rewrite it with
        some other framework.</p>

    <!-- <p>Hey, I'm Jamie.</p>

<p>I studied math at UCLA and spent a lot of time with the <a href="https://remap.ucla.edu">Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance</a>.</p>

<p>I used to work for the <a href="https://mggg.org">Metric Geometry Gerrymandering Group</a> at Tufts, doing a mix of programming and project management.</p>

<p>I did some other computer science jobs that I usually try to avoid naming for various reasons.</p>

<p>I now go to Harvard Law School where I'm majoring in law.</p> -->

    <h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
    <p>I run trivia at the HLS Pub. I will be posting (curated?) slides here.</p>
