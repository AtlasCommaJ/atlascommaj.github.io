<p>Hey, I'm Jamie.</p>

<p>I studied math at UCLA and spent a lot of time with the <a href="https://remap.ucla.edu">Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance</a>.</p>

<p>I used to work for the <a href="https://mggg.org">Metric Geometry Gerrymandering Group</a> at Tufts, doing a mix of programming and project management.</p>

<p>I did some other computer science jobs that I usually try to avoid naming for various reasons.</p>

<p>I now go to Harvard Law School where I'm majoring in law.</p>
