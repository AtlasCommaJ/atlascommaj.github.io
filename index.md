<p>Hey, I'm Jamie.</p>

<p>I studied math at UCLA and spent a lot of time with the <a href="https://remap.ucla.edu">Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance</a>.</p>

<p>I now work for the <a href="https://mggg.org">Metric Geometry Gerrymandering Group</a> at Tufts, doing a mix of programming and project management.</p>
